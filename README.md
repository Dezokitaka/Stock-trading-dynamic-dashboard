Excel data project


This is my favorite project thus far and the one that i'm most passionate about. In this project I go through every single one of my own investing plays from when I first started a year ago to ones that I made days ago.
I based the visalizations on a webiste called Tradervue and decided I wanted my own version of that but all on excel. I picked out the important values I would like to know and the ones that could help me understand how I can improve as a trader.
Everything I've done within this excel project was to figure out how I can improve as a trader based on my statistics.

Here are some of the questions I asked myself before I started this analysis.
1. What can I do to better my chances of being profitable?
2. Is there any patterns that is getting in the way of me being profitable?
3. What should I avoid doing in the future?

A quick summary of what statistics I created using formulas are
1. Avg. wins
2. Avg. Losses
3. total wins
4. total losses
5. Win %
6. Total scalp wins
7. total scalp losses
8. Avg hold time for wins and for losses
9. Total profit loss 
10. percentages of my success rate based on trading strategy

Visualizations that really helped me 
1. Performance by day
2. Performance by stock price
3. The other visualizations are for statistics not so much for improving my trading results.
